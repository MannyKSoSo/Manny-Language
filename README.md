# Manny-Language
This module adds the DND5e languages to the Foundry VTT Journals. Using the 'pre' tag will prevent the text from being encoded in the language font.

Module based off of https://github.com/Sanyella/FVTT-Custom-Journal-Theming. Both can be used at the same time, but the code is identical.

On each journal there will be a new "Language" button that will allow you to choose the font you want. Note that the fonts are generalized due to
there not being a seperate font for each language. If there ends up being more fonts for each language I will add them to the library for use.

Warning: symbols like , ! ( ) [ ] do not work with the language tags as the font does not contain those symobls.
